Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that enables developers to design custom interfaces directly within their HTML. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, which come with predefined components and styles, Tailwind CSS provides a wide range of low-level utility classes. These classes can be combined to create unique designs without needing to write custom CSS. This method offers greater flexibility and customization, allowing for precise control over styling. Additionally, Tailwind CSS simplifies the process of maintaining and scaling code by avoiding the need to override pre-existing styles. Its configuration options and Just-In-Time (JIT) mode optimize the final CSS output, resulting in smaller file sizes and improved performance.
